# Plan of Attack
## A simple app for tracking project plans

This app is primarily intended as a practice piece to gain better understanding of typescript, react native, and expo. Superficially, it also serves to track fabric, future sewing plans, and sewing projects. Hypothetically, it could be extended for other crafts or hobbies where the tracking of materials is useful. Feel free to fork and play around.

## To run locally

`npm start` - launches the expo app, which can be viewed in android, ios, or on web
`npm android` - launches the expo app for android devices
